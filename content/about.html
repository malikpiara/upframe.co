            <p>Upframe aims to become a <strong>global reference and authority in pre-acceleration,
                shaping the next generation of entrepreneurs by building an immersive experience
                focused on young aspiring startup builders.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>We want to empower a generation of entrepreneurs with a critical mindset
                and tools to follow their dreams, connecting them to the people and
                institutions who will smooth their journey.
            </p>

            <p>It's not our expectation that everyone who comes through our doors
                will already have a startup but it is our expectation that by the
                time they finish with us that they know that a startup dream is
                possible and plausible.

            <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
            <p>We are always and consistently learning, analysing and understanding
                what went well and what could have gone better. We are a 'work in progress',
                always growing through the result of previous smaller steps.

            <h3>Disruption</h3>
            <p>We embrace our true personality, being authentic in the way we communicate.
                We are not afraid to go after our dreams and objectives, solving the problems
                we set ourselves to work on, no matter how hard or crazy the solutions might be.

        <div>
            <h3>Sharing</h3>
            <p>Knowledge must be shared. If we work together, we can built build a
                stronger future for our country and the following generations,
                shaping experiences with the objective of promoting a more open
                and united society.

        <h2>To make this dream possible we have to thank Startup Lisboa and our mentors.</h2>

                <p><strong>Being Startup Lisboa Official Pre-Acceleration Programme
                    sets a high bar for quality, dedication and professionalism</strong>
                    that the most influential Portuguese incubator has been constantly
                    pushing up throughout their existence.
                </p>

                <p>In addition to their expertise we are supported by a <strong><u>group of
                    wonderful and experienced mentors</u></strong> who passed though companies
                    like Tesla, Twitter and Spotify, and many more.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>With Startup Lisboa support, guidance and supervision, but still
                    keeping our creative and organisational freedom, as well as with
                    the help of our dedicated mentors, we designed an immersive and
                    mentorship-driven, 6-week journey focused in solving problems
                    worth solving. â€” <a><u>A pre-acceleration programme unlike any
                    other in the world.</u></a>
                </p>

                <p>This mentorship-driven process will guide first-time entrepreneurs
                    to get their idea to an early stage of development.
